<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE.</h2>

<p>For some remarks on the nature and history of the <em>Sonnet</em> and
its peculiar excellence, as exemplified by Milton, the reader is
referred to the Notes at the close of this book. The Author regards
it as by its fixed laws and its structure the very best form of poetry
for one short, complete, meditative lesson. A collection of such
distinct, separate little poems,&mdash;mostly written within a recent
period,&mdash;and not mingled with other forms of poetry,&mdash;constitutes
this little volume.</p>

<p>The notes annexed are historical and illustrative, elucidatory of
what from the necessary brevity of the verse might be otherwise
left obscure, or such as seemed to be required by the unevasible
claims and the infinite worth of the revealed Christian truth, which
makes the texture of these sonnets.</p>

<p>While Petrarch, the inventor of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Sonetto</i>, Spenser, Shakespeare,
Wordsworth, and other foreign poets have written a
multitude of sonnets, it is to the author a matter of surprise, that not
more than half a dozen sonnets&mdash;within his knowledge&mdash;have ever
been sent forth by any one of our poets; so that this may be
regarded as the first book of American Sonnets ever published.</p>

<p>An old man, the tenant for a year past of a sick chamber, who
from early life has been a student and cultivator of poetry, has found
not a little pleasure in such musings, as he now offers to the public.
His meditations, it may well be supposed, have not been of fictitious
scenes. Aware of his liableness at any moment to be summoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
away from this world,&mdash;which to his eye is filled with
beauty mingled indeed with deformity,&mdash;into a world of undefaced
loveliness and eternal glory, he could not have excused himself, if
he had employed the precarious time lent to him in drawing idle,
uninstructive, unprofitable pictures; but his mind has been filled
with intense thoughts on God's pure, unchanging, soul-saving
Truth; and he has endeavored to give true sketches, however faint
and feeble, of divine and eternal realities not unworthy of the
contemplation nor unfit to awaken the affections of rational,
immortal men. The uninterrupted study of God's Word for 50
or 60 years may be his apology for declaring what in his judgment
are plainly and indubitably some of the great truths of that Word.
But he earnestly asks the reader to search the Scriptures with his
own eyes. What God has said is true.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">REMARKS ON THE NATURE AND HISTORY OF THE SONNET.</h2>

<p>In the judgment of some of the greatest poets and literary men
the <em>Sonnet</em> is a form of poetry of very high value; in its structure
a precious gem. It is of Italian origin and was invented by
<i>Petrarch</i> in the 14th century. In his retreat at Vaucluse near
Avignon he wrote the greater part of his sonnets, all devoted to
the idolatry of woman&mdash;to the praise of Laura: 227 of them were
written while she was living; and he continued to extol her in
90 sonnets after her death.</p>

<p>The laws of the sonnet are these. It has one leading subject
and should end with some striking thought, or must bring to a
beautiful conclusion or point the images and musings of the first
lines and greater part of the poem. It has always 14 lines, falling
into two unequal lobes, one of two quatrains, the other of two
triplets; or in other words it is composed of four stanzas, the two
first of four lines each and the two last of three lines each. Then
as to the rhymes,&mdash;the first eight lines have only two rhymes, and
they always in the same place,&mdash;the first, fourth, fifth and eighth
lines rhyming; so also the other four. The last six lines admit of
a little change, and may have either two or three rhymes; usually
the four first lines have alternate rhymes, and the two last are a
couplet; but even in this case the triplet form is to be preserved.</p>

<p>The distinction of the stanzas is made, not by a separation from
each other by wider spaces, but while printed compactly by the
lines 1, 5, 9, and 12, projecting to the left; as in Milton's sonnets
and in the Venice edition of Petrarch in 1764. Various poets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
however have unwisely disregarded this rule: and have variously
placed their rhymes and their lines at their pleasure. Campbell
has translated a few of Petrarch's sonnets, reducing the 14 lines to
12, composed of three similar quatrains, the first and last lines of
which rhyme together. But this is destroying the Sonnet.</p>

<p>Our admiration of Petrarch should perhaps be a little moderated;
for he is full of affected turns and paradoxes and smart antitheses.
Speaking of love he says, "O viva morte, O dilettoso male,"&mdash;O
living death, O most beloved evil! Speaking also of its effect
he says in four lines of rhyme, which may be thus translated&mdash;without
rhyme&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"I find no peace, and am not the subject of war;</div>
      <div class="verse">I fear, and hope, and also burn, and freeze;</div>
      <div class="verse">I fly above the heavens, and walk on the earth;</div>
      <div class="verse">I grasp nothing, and hold the universe in my arms."</div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>Addressing a river, in which Laura washed her face, he says,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Thou hast no rock beneath thy waves, which does not burn with the same
fires, that are kindled in me." He also said, "O earth, thou art not worthy to
be trodden by her feet. She deserves to adorn heaven!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His curious stanza repeating the word <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">dolce</i>, sweet, 9 or 10
times may be thus translated:</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"Sweet sorrow, and sweet joy, and then sweet pain,</div>
      <div class="verse">Sweet torture, zephyr, fire, and next sweet wounds;</div>
      <div class="verse">Sweet word, which in my ear most sweetly sounds,</div>
      <div class="verse">Sweet anger, and sweet rage, and sweet disdain."</div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>The sonnet in the use of Petrarch did not attain its highest
dignity, for it was wholly appropriated to the praise of Laura, his
love for whom whether real or fictitious has not yet been settled
by the literary world. He died in 1374, aged 70.&mdash;The eminent
English poet Spenser followed him after an interval of more than
200 years dying in 1598: he published 87 sonnets. Then Shakespeare,
who died in 1616, published 154 sonnets; all of which by
these two poets are devoted to love, but with a change of the
Italian rhyme and form.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>The following shows the sonnet's structure by <i>Spenser</i>.</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"Men call you fair, and you do credit it,</div>
      <div class="verse">For that your self ye daily such do see,</div>
      <div class="verse">But the true fair, that is, the gentle wit</div>
      <div class="verse">And virtuous mind is much more prais'd of me;</div>
      <div class="verse">For all the rest, however fair it be,</div>
      <div class="verse">Shall turn to naught, and lose that glorious hue;</div>
      <div class="verse">But only that is permanent and free</div>
      <div class="verse">From frail corruption, that doth flesh ensew:</div>
      <div class="verse">That is true beauty; that doth argue you</div>
      <div class="verse">To be divine, and born of heav'nly seed,</div>
      <div class="verse">Deriv'd from that fair Spirit from whom all true</div>
      <div class="verse">And perfect beauty did at first proceed:</div>
      <div class="verse">He only fair, and what he fair hath made;</div>
      <div class="verse">All other fair, like flow'rs, untimely fade."</div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>It will be observed, that the last couplet is always a rhyme,
which is not the fixed rule of Petrarch; and then he has changed
the places of the rhymes and confused them by abolishing the
stanzas.</p>

<p>The following is a sonnet of <i>Shakespeare</i>.</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"O, how much more doth beauty beauteous seem</div>
      <div class="verse">By that sweet ornament which truth doth give!</div>
      <div class="verse">The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem</div>
      <div class="verse">For that sweet odor which doth in it live.</div>
      <div class="verse">The canker-blooms have full as deep a dye,</div>
      <div class="verse">As the perfumed tincture of the roses;</div>
      <div class="verse">Hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly,</div>
      <div class="verse">When summer's breath their masked buds discloses:</div>
      <div class="verse">But for their virtue only is their show;</div>
      <div class="verse">They live unwoo'd, and unrespected fade;</div>
      <div class="verse">Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so;</div>
      <div class="verse">Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odors made:</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth;</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">When that shall fade, my verse distils your truth."</div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>Here also is an injurious change in the sonnet of Petrarch: the
last couplet is always a rhyme, and it is separated in print from the
12 lines, which are very simple, composing three stanzas of distinct,
alternate rhymes, much easier to compose than Spenser's or
the Italian.</p>

<p><i>Milton</i> wrote 5 sonnets in Italian, which were translated by
Cowper. In them he followed Petrarch in his subject. It was in
his 18 English sonnets, that he has given to this form of poetry its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
true elevation and dignity. Instead of applying it, like his predecessors,
to love meditations, expressive of fictitious or real affection,
he made it the instrument of conveying most important
moral, patriotic, and religious sentiments.</p>

<p>The following is a sonnet of Milton, who died in 1675. It was
addressed to</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="title">A VIRTUOUS YOUNG LADY.</div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"Lady, that in the prime of earliest youth</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">Wisely hast shunn'd the broad way and the green,</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">And with those few art eminently seen,</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">That labor up the hill of heav'nly truth,</div>
      <div class="verse">The better part with Mary and with Ruth</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">Chosen thou hast; and they, that overween,</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">And at thy growing virtues fret their spleen,</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">No anger find in thee, but pity and ruth.</div>
      <div class="verse">Thy care is fix'd, and zealously attends</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">To fill thy od'rous lamp with deeds of light,</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">And hope that reaps not shame. Therefore be sure</div>
      <div class="verse">Thou, when the bridegroom with his feastful friends</div>

<p>It will be seen, that he combined with his rhymes much of the
freedom and force of blank verse. He never allows the absence of
good strong sense nor the presence of unmeaning or useless words
in order to make out the rhyme.</p>

<p>By printing his sonnets compactly without separating the stanzas
from each other Milton carried on his sentences, as he found
desirable, from stanza to stanza, frequently without any close at
the end of a stanza, sometimes just beginning near the end. In
this case the separation of the stanzas by spaces would evidently
be absurd. Read the last five lines of his sonnet to Cromwell:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse indent9">"Peace hath her victories</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">No less renown'd than war: new foes arise</div>
      <div class="verse">Threat'ning to bind our souls with sec'lar chains.&mdash;</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">Help us to save free conscience from the paw</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">Of hireling wolves, whose gospel is their maw."</div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>Here, in the method of separating the stanzas by wider spaces
in printing, the phrase "new foes arise" would have been separated
from the line which follows, with which it is so intimately
connected,&mdash;the head line of the last triplet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>The author may here be allowed to say, that in his judgment in
the whole compass of English poetry there are no sonnets equal to
a few of Milton's, numbered 8, 9, 14, 15, 18, 19, 22 and 23. If
any one would know, whether Milton's meditations brought out
sentiments worthy of utterance, and whether he knew how to utter
them with the melody of rhyme and at the same time with the
unshackled freedom and energy of blank verse, I leave with him
for his refreshment the following lines from his sonnet on his own
Blindness:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse indent1">"Doth God exact day-labor, light denied?"</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">I fondly ask: But Patience, to prevent</div>
      <div class="verse">That murmur, soon replies, "God doth not need</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">Either man's work, or his own gifts; who best</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">Bear his mild yoke, they serve him best: his state</div>
      <div class="verse">Is kingly; thousands at his bidding speed,</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">And post o'er land and ocean without rest:</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">They also serve, who only stand and wait."</div>
    </div>

<p>More recently <i>Wordsworth</i>, who died in 1850, aged 80, has followed Milton in his application of this form of poetry to higher
subjects than that to which it was applied by Petrarch. A very
great fault however is his abolishing Milton's method of designating
the stanzas and thus showing the places of the rhymes, the
pleasures of which are gone if their places are not easily found.
He wrote 282 sonnets: he wrote too many; and they are often
diffuse and languid. The following is one of his sonnets: it is on
the Pastoral Character.</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"A genial hearth, a hospitable board,</div>
      <div class="verse">And a refined rusticity belong</div>
      <div class="verse">To the neat mansion, where, his Flock among,</div>
      <div class="verse">The learned Pastor dwells, their watchful Lord.</div>
      <div class="verse">Though meek and patient as a sheathed sword,</div>
      <div class="verse">Though pride's least lurking thought appear a wrong</div>
      <div class="verse">To human kind; though peace be on his tongue,</div>
      <div class="verse">Gentleness in his heart; can earth afford</div>
      <div class="verse">Such genuine state, pre-eminence so free,</div>
      <div class="verse">As when, array'd in Christ's authority,</div>
      <div class="verse">He from the pulpit lifts his awful hand;</div>
      <div class="verse">Conjures, implores, and labors all he can</div>
      <div class="verse">For re-subjecting to divine command</div>
      <div class="verse">The stubborn spirit of rebellious man?"</div>
    </div>

<p>The readers of poetry ought to feel much indebted to Mr. Wordsworth
for his remarks in regard to the language of poetry, and in
regard to the value of enkindled emotions. In his judgment, there
ought not to be a distinct poetic diction, separate from the language
of good prose; the poet should aim at good sense and
intelligible diction, using the language of men, abandoning "a
large portion of phrases and figures of speech, which from father to
son have long been regarded as the common inheritance of poets,"
and even abstaining from many good expressions, which bad poets
have so foolishly and perpetually repeated, as to render them disgusting.
As illustrating his meaning, he quotes from a sonnet of
<i>Gray;</i>&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"In vain to me the smiling mornings shine,</div>
      <div class="verse">And reddening Phœbus lifts his golden fire:</div>
      <div class="verse">The birds in vain their amorous descants join,</div>
      <div class="verse">Or cheerful fields resume their green attire:</div>
      <div class="verse">These ears, alas! for other notes repine."</div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>Here this false diction destroys the value of every line.</p>

<p>The other remark of Mr. Wordsworth is this;&mdash;"all good poetry
is the spontaneous overflow of good feelings." Perhaps it might
be also said, that in addition to sensibility and impassioned
expression there should be chosen, for the highest poetry, subjects
of moral dignity and religious interest, having a close bearing on
human welfare not only for a moment but for perpetuity.</p>

<p><a name="Sonnet_Note_1" id="Sonnet_Note_1"></a><a href="#Sonnet_1"><i>Sonnet 1.</i></a> The name of <span class="smcap">Washington</span> is in the heart of all
Americans. Fifty years ago, that is in 1809, in the first edition of
the American Biographical Dictionary, I devoted nearly 20 pages
to a memoir of Washington. It may be a convenience to the
reader of this little book to have here collected the dates as to the
leading events of his life.&mdash;He was born at Bridges Creek, Westmoreland
county, Virginia, Feb. 22, 1732; and died suddenly, after
an illness of one day by an inflammation of the windpipe, Dec. 14,
1799, nearly 68 years old. He was in early life a major and colonel
of the Virginia troops employed against the French on the Ohio in
1754 and 1755; and was subsequently commander in chief. About
1758 he married Mrs. Custis, a wealthy widow, whom he greatly
loved. As a planter he had 9,000 acres of land under his management,
and nearly 1,000 slaves in his employment, living at Mount
Vernon, which was the estate of his deceased older brother Lawrence:
his father's name was Augustine: his great grandfather
came from the north of England about 1657.&mdash;He was appointed
by congress commander in chief at the commencement of the war
in 1775; and at the close resigned his commission Dec. 1783.</p>

<p>In 1789 he was chosen the first president of the United States
for 4 years and then re-chosen, continuing in office till 1797, when
he was succeeded by John Adams. By his last will he directed,
that on the death of Mrs. Washington (who died May 22, 1802,)
his slaves should be emancipated. As the ladies of Virginia, with
the aid of ladies of other States, have purchased Mount Vernon in
reverence to the name of Washington, will they not honor him if
they manage it without obtruding upon it any slave labor?&mdash;Gen.
Washington was a constant attendant on public worship in an
episcopal church, which he principally supported. It is believed,
that he every day had his hour of retirement for private devotion.</p>

<p><a name="Sonnet_Note_2" id="Sonnet_Note_2"></a><a href="#Sonnet_2"><i>Sonnet 2.</i></a> In looking from my eastern window a few evenings
since (Dec. 12th,) I was struck with the magnificent appearance of
the heavens,&mdash;the moon just rising in full effulgence, preceded a
few degrees by the splendid planet Jupiter, while still higher and
more at the south was the unequalled constellation Orion, with an
uncounted multitude of stars planted thick in the sky. Jupiter is
1400 times larger than the earth, being 90,000 miles in diameter:
he revolves on his axis in ten hours, so that a body on his surface
flies around at the rate of 27,000 miles per hour, or 27 times faster
than a body on the earth. It has four satellites. Can it be
imagined, that this huge planet is not furnished with rational
inhabitants, like this diminutive earth? And what reason can be
assigned why all the planets and all the stars should not be inhabited
by rational beings? Who can fix the limits to God's creation?
As light flies 192,000 miles every second, who can say, that
the light from the most distant star has yet reached the earth since
the star was created? With what reverence and awe, with what
love and trust and spirit of obedience should Almighty God, the
Creator of the universe, be regarded?</p>

<p><a name="Sonnet_Note_3" id="Sonnet_Note_3"></a><a href="#Sonnet_3"><i>Sonnet 3.</i></a> Wm. H. Prescott, the distinguished historian, died at
Boston of the paralysis after a few hours' illness Jan. 28, 1859,
aged 62 years. Knowing that he was about to die, it was his
remarkable request, that in his coffin he might lie for a time with
his face uncovered in his library, surrounded by his cherished
Books. From his library he was carried to his grave Jan. 31st.
The next evening the Historical Society of Massachusetts held a
meeting in honor of his memory. Mr. Winthrop, the president,
Mr. Ticknor who introduced some resolutions, and others made
speeches on the occasion, which were published. As a humble
associate member of the society I would not neglect to mention
the following apposite and interesting fact, that <i>Petrarch</i>, the
inventor of the Italian <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">sonetto</i>, was found dead in his library with
his head <em>resting on a book</em>. He died of apoplexy July 18, 1374,
aged 74.&mdash;Milton's memorable words in relation to books ought
never to be forgotten:&mdash;"Many a man lives a burden to the earth;
but <em>a good book</em> is the precious life-blood of a master-spirit, imbalmed
and treasured up on purpose to a life beyond life."&mdash;But
the book of books is God's Book, which infinitely transcends all
others in value, except as they borrow truth from its pages, for it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
reveals to man his pathway to a blessed immortality. Never should
the words of Mr. Chillingworth be forgotten: "The <span class="smcap">Bible</span>, I say,
the <span class="smcap">Bible</span> only is the Religion of Protestants."</p>

<p><a name="Sonnet_Note_5" id="Sonnet_Note_5"></a><a href="#Sonnet_5"><i>Sonnet 5.</i></a> After the existence of one God there is no truth so
astonishing and holding such a power over the human heart, as the
death of the Son of God on the cross for the sins of men. For
who was the Son of God? He was indeed in the form of a man,
born of the virgin Mary; but he came down from heaven to tabernacle
in human flesh. Let us raise our eyes from the earth to
the worlds above us, of enormous magnitude compared with this
little globe of ours. Suppose now the glorious sun is inhabited by
a race of intelligent beings as much exalted above man, as the sun
is greater and more resplendent than the earth. If the highest of
the sun's inhabitants had come to this low world and dwelt in
human flesh&mdash;it might have been a most amazing event in our
eyes; yet he would not have been the Son of God. Suppose
among the countless worlds of light there is one world vastly
transcending all others and the dwellers on it transcending in their
faculties and endowments all other world-dwellers; and the first
among them had come to dwell in man's form; yet he would not
have been the Son of God. We read of angels and archangels in
heaven&mdash;in the place of God's more especial abode. Suppose the
brightest archangel had descended to this ball of earth and animated
a human form, and appeared as a man; yet he would not
have been the Son of God. For the Son of God is he, by whom
God created the sun and moon and stars of light, with all the
intelligent dwellers upon them and the dwellers in the heavenly
mansions. It was this Son of God inconceivably exalted and glorious,
who came down from heaven and appeared as the Son of
Mary. And not only so; but he actually was subject to the evils,
which man suffers; he could feel pain, and anguish, and the
agonies of the cross,&mdash;and did encounter them,&mdash;if the plain language<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
of scripture is no delusion,&mdash;in order to atone for our sins
and to achieve the work of our redemption. Now, did we believe
this: did this most sublime and wonderful truth plant itself in our
inmost persuasion,&mdash;unalloyed and unweakened or not destroyed
in its influence by any of our speculative theories;&mdash;were we
deeply and thoroughly convinced of this great fact;&mdash;then who of
us could fail to exclaim,&mdash;"God forbid, that I should glory, save in
the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified
unto me and I unto the world?"</p>

<p><a name="Sonnet_Note_22" id="Sonnet_Note_22"></a><a href="#Sonnet_22"><i>Sonnet 22.</i></a> Ten years ago, in 1849, I had the satisfaction of
visiting the valley of Chamouni in Switzerland at the foot of Mont
Blanc, the highest point in Europe, 15,600 or 15,673 feet or nearly
3 miles in height above the sea. Here once lived Jacques Balmat,
who, having discovered a way to the top of the mountain, in his
gratitude to Dr. Paccard, the physician of the village, apprized
him of his discovery, and undertook to conduct him to the summit.
After two days' toil the exploit was accomplished Aug. 8, 1786.
The next ascent was by De Saussure, the elder, of Geneva, accompanied
by his servant, by Balmat, and 17 other guides, Aug. 3,
1787. In 1808 Balmat conducted to the top 15 of the people of
Chamouni, one of whom was a woman, Maria Parodis. Ascents
were made by men of different countries in 1802, 1812, and 1818.
Two Americans accomplished this ascent in 1819, Dr. Wm. Howard
of Baltimore and Dr. Van Rensselaer, with 9 guides. They
reached the top Monday, July 12th. Remaining more than an hour
on the summit, they reached Chamouni in safety after an absence
of 53 hours only.&mdash;Capt. Underhill of England made the ascent in
the same year. The lives of three guides were lost in the attempt
of Dr. Hamel in 1820. Since then there were 27 ascents, to the
year 1851, when Albert Smith and other Englishmen went up with
16 guides Aug. 13th.</p>

some expressions, which seem to conflict with each other, some
patience and diligence of inquiry may be requisite in order to

to God for his book of revealed truth, proved to be divine by the
voice of prophecy, by the wonders of miracles, by the sublimity of
its doctrines, and by the approval of conscience. Every man, who
can read, is bound to examine this book for himself; for otherwise
his faith will rest on a human not a divine teacher.&mdash;According to
Mr. Chillingworth, what God requires of us is "to believe the
Scripture to be God's word, to endeavor to find the true sense of
it, and to live according to it." He also says&mdash;"I see plainly and
with mine own eyes, that there are popes against popes, Councils
against Councils, some Fathers against others, the same Fathers
against themselves, a Consent of Fathers of one age against a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Consent of Fathers of another age, the Church of one age against
the Church of another age. Traditive interpretations of Scripture
are pretended, but there are few or none to be found. No tradition,
but only of Scripture, can derive itself from the fountain."&mdash;"Propose
me any thing out of this book, and require whether I
believe it or no; and seem it never so incomprehensible to human
reason, I will subscribe it with hand and heart: As knowing no
demonstration can be stronger than this; God hath said so, therefore
it is true." But then we ought to be well assured, that God
hath said what we attribute to him; that we understand the import
of the divine word; and that no prepossession, or prejudice, or
passion, or mental bondage leads us into an inexcusable misapprehension.</p>

at Brunswick in Maine June 3, 1828, aged 40 years, was the
only daughter and child of Dr. John Wheelock, the president of
Dartmouth College. She was of Huguenot descent by her mother,
Maria Suhm, the daughter of Christian Suhm, the Danish commandant
and governor of the island of St. Thomas: he died in
1759, aged 40, being a native of Copenhagen. Mrs. Suhm's descent
was from Thomas Bourdeau of the south or west of France,
a protestant martyr after the revocation of the edict of Nantes in
1685, as follows. He sent his only daughter Maria at the age of
ten years for safety to the island of St. Thomas. In the same
vessel was a protestant emigrant from the same place, Mr. La Salle,
whom she at the age of 15 married. Their daughter Maria La Salle
married John Malleville of St. Thomas: their daughter, Maria
Malleville, married in 1751 governor Suhm, who after his death
was succeeded by her brother, Gov. Thomas Malleville. Her second
marriage was to Lucas Von Beverhoudt of Beverwyck in
Parsippany, New Jersey, where she was accustomed to receive
Washington at her house. Their daughter, Adriana, married
T. Boudinot, the descendant of another Huguenot family from
France.&mdash;She died in 1798. Her daughter, Maria Suhm, married,

American town and a brave patriot of the revolution is a matter of
interest. Thomas Allen was born in Northampton and was a
descendant of Samuel, one of the first settlers, whose father&mdash;dying
at Windsor in 1648&mdash;is supposed to have come over from the west
of England with the Dorchester people in the ship Mary and John
in 1630.&mdash;His grandfather, named also Samuel, was an unswerving
friend of Jonathan Edwards and a deacon in his church. Mr. Allen
graduated at Harvard college in 1762 in a distinguished class,
among whose members were Gov. Gerry, Judge F. Dana, and
Drs. Eliot and Belknap. He was ordained at Pittsfield in Berkshire
county, Mass., April 18, 1764, and here passed the remainder
of his life; he died after a ministry of 45 years Feb. 11, 1810, aged
67 years: I was ordained his successor Oct. 10, 1810.&mdash;He was not
only a faithful and eloquent minister; but a patriot, and a chaplain
in the army, and on one occasion he played the part of a soldier.
He marched Aug. 15, 1777 with a company of his own people in a
three days' campaign to Bennington to check the advance of
Burgoyne:&mdash;the next day he shared in the assault and the victory;&mdash;and
the third day he returned home to preach the gospel to his
rejoicing people Aug. 18th. His trophies often delighted my eyes
in subsequent years,&mdash;two large, square, white flint-glass bottles,
which he captured with a Hessian surgeon's horse, and gave the
wine to the wounded.</p>

<p>His wife was Elizabeth, the daughter of Rev. Jonathan Lee, the
first minister of Salisbury, Conn.; she was descended from Gov.
Bradford of Plymouth; she died in 1830, aged 82. Of their 12
children the writer of this is the only survivor.&mdash;On the death of
his eldest daughter, Mrs. White in London, he went to England
in 1799 in order to bring his little grand-child to his house: in
London he became acquainted with the eminent ministers Newton,
Haweis, Rowland Hill, and Bogue, and from them caught a pious
zeal for the promotion of foreign missions. He published sermons
on the death of his daughter, E. White, 1798; of Moses Allen,

<p><a name="Sonnet_Note_62" id="Sonnet_Note_62"></a><a href="#Sonnet_62"><i>Sonnet 62.</i></a> Mr. Robinson, born in England in 1585 and educated
at Cambridge, becoming a protestant minister, was driven by
persecution with his people into Holland. His church at Leyden
consisted of 300 communicants. He zealously promoted the emigration
under elder Brewster to Plymouth in 1620, intending to
follow; but he died in 1625. It was his memorable remark&mdash;"I
am very confident the Lord has more truth yet to break forth out of
his holy word."</p>

<p><a name="Sonnet_Note_64" id="Sonnet_Note_64"></a><a href="#Sonnet_64"><i>Sonnet 64.</i></a> When Jesus said, "I am the Way, the Truth, and
the Life," he announced to us the infinite value of truth as the
path-way to immortal life. Truth is immutable and eternal; it is
most pure and purifying, the source of joy and the foundation of
hope; and the denial of truth is more or less perilous and implies
more or less of guilt. All falsehood is injurious. As the Bible
reveals to us divine truth, how can we doubt, whether we are
bound to study it with our own eyes? For otherwise we must
accept for the teachings of the holy word the faith of some one of
the authors of a hundred different creeds; and we may perchance
have for our great teacher and master some bewildered lunatic, or
some hungry impostor, or some proud and boastful promoter of the
purposes of the father of lies.</p>

<p>The catholic may use the term <em>mystery</em> as a cover for absurdity
and contempt of reason, or in support of a contradiction, and as
an excuse for idolatry; but surely God's Bible contains nothing
but truth, and that revealed in a manner adapted to the human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
understanding. But what says archbishop Fenelon in defending
transubstantiation or the imagined change of the bread in the
sacrament into the body of Christ? He says of the doctrine&mdash;"in
believing its mysteries one immolates his ideas [or sacrifices his
common sense] out of respect to eternal truth." Thus his blunder,
his misunderstanding of Christ's words, "this is my body," he
represents as "eternal truth." So Bourdaloue says&mdash;"I make to
God a sacrifice of the most noble part of myself, which is my
reason:" and he professes to believe a mystery "although it seems
to be directly repugnant to my reason;"&mdash;or one "which shocks
reason itself and contradicts all its lights," referring to the received
doctrine concerning God's nature. Massillon thinks it is "necessary
to believe certain apparent contradictions:" he says, "it is
faith and not reason, which makes us Christians." All this
in my view is a pernicious error: for <em>reason</em> is the intellectual
power, which discerns truth. God himself is perfect reason, pure
intellect, infinite understanding. To him the universe is all light.
But our reason is restricted: man may grow in knowledge forever;
yet he never will know an absurdity or contradiction to be
true. To us one great source of truth is God's testimony or revelation.
<em>Faith</em> is the belief of God's testimony. As to the word
<em>mystery</em>, the common meaning of it in scripture, is not something
unintelligible, but a <em>doctrine, once hidden or secret, which is now
revealed and intelligible</em>. Thus in teaching the resurrection Paul
says, "Behold, I <em>shew</em> you a mystery; we shall not all sleep," &amp;c.
1 Cor. 15:51. See also Rom. 16:25.</p>

<p>It is clear beyond a question, that there cannot be two contradictory
truths; for truth is one; it is but an expression of the
reality of things. But some metaphysicians have lent their aid to
the catholic theologians by asserting that, there are contradictory
truths in philosophy; but the instances adduced are all fallacious,
as Achilles walking 20 times as fast as the turtle, but never able to
overtake him.</p>

<p>A lately deceased philosopher of Scotland, Sir W. Hamilton,
seems to concur in the catholic notion of the contradiction of faith
and reason. He lays down a certain new, strange, unproved,
incredible principle, called "the law of the conditioned," that "the
conceivable always lies between two contradictory extremes;" and
then concludes as "the one true and only orthodox inference" that
we must believe in the infinity of God, which by us cannot be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
comprehended or conceived. "Faith,&mdash;Belief,&mdash;is the organ, by
which we apprehend what is beyond our knowledge." But how
can this be correct? When we exercise <em>faith</em> in God's testimony,&mdash;when
we exercise <em>belief</em> in his word,&mdash;when we receive the very
truth, which he presents to our understanding or reason and brings
to our knowledge,&mdash;do we not <em>know</em> it? Do we thus apprehend
any thing "beyond our knowledge?" When Christ prayed&mdash;"sanctify
them through thy truth; thy word is truth;"&mdash;did he
not refer to truth <em>known?</em> What God reveals must be revealed to
our belief, to our reason. Although we pretend not to comprehend
perfectly the attributes and ways of the infinite God; yet what he
has disclosed we may know; and we may know the meaning of
right and wrong, of truth and falsehood, of faith and unbelief, of
reason and contradiction or absurdity. It cannot then be a right
inference&mdash;if the author had such a meaning&mdash;that any doctrine
concerning the nature of God may be true, although not <em>conceivable</em>,
because God is <em>infinite</em>.</p>

<p>God's scheme of mercy towards sinful man is accomplished by
the wide-spread power and triumphs of Truth. But what are the
Truths, that bear intimately on human welfare? Surely it is not
a matter of indifference what is received for truth; men are not
safe, because they think they are so. No bigoted despotism; no
boasted liberalism; no banded relationships of interest or honor;
no infidel companionship or self-applauses can convert error into
truth or render it harmless. Whatever monstrous or astounding
notions, whatever wild, fanatical, profligate, misleading doctrine
may be sent forth, no glozing words can render it otherwise, than
that error and falsehood are God's abhorrence and a delusion of
the devil.</p>

<p>As I have in other notes dwelt upon the character and offices of
the Son of God, the Mediator and Redeemer, I desire now to advert
to the all-important divine teaching concerning God's Spirit, grace,
and power in renewing and sanctifying the depraved and lost soul
of man. "God hath mercy on whom he will have mercy." Rom.
9th. Christ taught, John 3d, the necessity of being "born of the
Spirit" in order to salvation. John the Baptist predicted of Christ,
that he should baptize men "with the Holy Spirit;" and thus his
coming was signalized by "the Spirit like a dove descending upon
him," and God's voice from heaven said, "Thou art my beloved
Son." All the powers therefore, prophetical, miraculous, renovating,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
and sanctifying, implied in the full endowment of the Holy Spirit,
were possessed by Christ.</p>

<p>The primitive meaning of the word Spirit is air or breath. Some
of its meanings in scripture are wind; the living soul in man and
animals; the mind, or man's intelligent part and also its various
faculties and powers; an intelligent spirit, simple, superior to
man's, not allied to matter; it is applied to angels good and evil;
and also to God, as we read, "God is a spirit." It means also the
divine power, given to Christ, by which he wrought miracles and
fulfilled God's purposes on the earth, as Matt. 12:28, "if I cast out
devils by the spirit of God," compared with Luke 11:20, "if I
with the finger of God cast out devils." In the same sense is
"holy spirit," with which Jesus was filled used, Luke 4:1.&mdash;"The
holy spirit" and "spirit" alone relating to the same matter are
found in Mark 12:36, and Matt. 22:43: "doth David <em>in spirit</em> call
him Lord;" that is, David was under divine <em>inspiration</em> is the one
meaning of the two expressions.</p>

<p>In our inquiry concerning the import of the phrase, "the holy
spirit," in scripture it may be of some consequence to bear in
mind, that there is one peculiarity in our English Bible, which
distinguishes it from other modern European translations; that
while the Greek testament has but one word for Spirit, which is
translated by one word,&mdash;in German by Geist, in Dutch by Geest, in
French by Esprit,&mdash;the same is rendered by our translators into
English by two words at their option, namely, <i>Spirit</i> and <i>Ghost</i>.
And in what cases did they choose the latter word? It would
seem that they translated by Holy Ghost and not by holy spirit
whenever they supposed the phrase had reference to an intelligent,
divine Being and not to a gift, endowment, or power received from
God. Thus it is, that the phrase has got an established meaning;
which shows indeed the judgment of our old translators 250 years
ago, but proves nothing as to the true meaning. It might then be
well, if the old word Ghost were laid aside. Indeed they have not
chosen to say, Gala. 4:6, "the Ghost of his Son," nor in v. 27,
"born after the Ghost," but have used the word "Spirit." If one
should take up his New Testament and read in English in Matthew's
first chapter concerning Mary,&mdash;"she was found with child
of the <i>Holy Ghost</i>," and then again, "that which is conceived of
her is of the <i>Holy Ghost</i>," he would be likely to attach a meaning
to the scripture, which he reads, different from the truth. For as
the Testament was written in Greek, we may learn from that language,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the translation should not have been "the Holy Ghost," and
not even "<em>the</em> Holy Spirit," but "<em>a</em> holy spirit," for here the word
for spirit has no article before it in the Greek, as would be requisite
if "<em>the</em> Spirit" were meant; and the meaning is, as learned critics
have showed, simply, "a divine energy or power." Just so in Mark
1:8 and Luke 1:35, the same Greek phrase has no article; and
the apostles do not allude to a great personage or supposed well
known, mighty Being, called "<em>the</em> Holy Ghost," but refer only to
God's miraculous power in respect to the birth of Christ. The verse
in Luke 1, proves this&mdash;"a holy spirit shall come upon thee and the
power of the Highest shall overshadow thee,"&mdash;both phrases
referring to the same energy of almighty God.</p>

<p>The English translators, although they have employed the phrase,
"the Holy Ghost" about 90 times in scripture, have not once in
the Old Testament, although they have three times there used
"the holy spirit" relating to God's gift, or endowment, or power
bestowed: Ps. 51:1. Isa. 63:10, 11. The same phrase, meaning
God's gift to believers, is in the New Testament: Luke 11:13.
Eph. 1:13-4:30. 1st Thess. 4:8. God gave "his spirit without
measure" to Christ; John 3:34; and he also gave "the spirit of
his Son," "the holy spirit," to believers: Gal. 4:6. The "gifts
of the Holy Ghost," in Heb. 2:4, should have been, "distributions
of <em>a</em> holy spirit or divine power;" for the phrase has no article in
the Greek, so that the verse might properly read, "God bearing
them witness both with signs, and wonders, and with divers
miracles, and distributions of a divine power." In like manner
there is no article in Acts 11:16, and 24, and other passages,
translated "the Holy Ghost." The meaning is plain, v. 24, "a
good man, and full of a divine power and of faith,"&mdash;Yet for the
purpose of emphasis the article is often used.</p>

<p>The importance of the doctrine concerning the spirit or the holy
spirit in the gospel scheme, importing God's holy influence on the
soul, is evident by the injunction of Christ as to baptism in the
faith of it: "teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, &amp;c."</p>

<p>Matt. 28:19, does not indeed present a form of words to be
used, nor does it relate to the authority, by which baptism is
to be administered, for the Greek preposition is not <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">en</i>, "<em>in</em> the
name," but <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">eis</i>, <em>into;</em> which is the same as "to baptize <em>into</em>
Christ," Rom. 6:3, i.e. into a profession of faith in Christ, as
taught by bishop Pearce. That he had himself all authority was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
first asserted by Christ; then he enjoined baptism under a profession
of belief in the three great points of his teaching,&mdash;as to
the one God of Israel,&mdash;as to himself, God's Son from heaven,&mdash;and
as to the Spirit, which "God gave to him without measure,"&mdash;giving
it also to his disciples,&mdash;making him indeed the great
teacher and Savior of the world. He finally commanded his
apostles, not only thus to baptize, but also to teach all nations to
observe whatever he had enjoined. A passage of similar import is
at the close of II Corinth., where Paul wishes his brethren may
experience the grace of Christ, and the love of God, and might
have a common participation of the holy spirit, of the miraculous
and sanctifying divine power.</p>

<p>It is worthy of remark, that while Paul begins each of his Epistles,
written to brethren of very different nations on the earth, with
asserting, that his authority as an apostle was derived from God
and from his Son, or with wishing his brethren grace, mercy and
peace from God the Father, and from his Son, by whom he created,
and governs, and will judge the world; yet he never in this manner
connects "the holy spirit" with the name of God and of his
Son our Lord Jesus Christ: no prayer is thus addressed to a holy
spirit or to the holy spirit, or Holy Ghost, although we find
the translation "the Holy Ghost," nearly 100 times. This is
called a gift of God, and God is prayed to for it; and it is
declared, that God anointed Jesus with the holy spirit, that
is, with the wonderful powers expressed by the phrase. A
multitude of passages speak of the Spirit as a divine power
and a divine gift: the following are some of the expressions used&mdash;"the
Spirit of your Father;"&mdash;"the Spirit of God;"&mdash;"God hath
sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts;"&mdash;"how much
more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that
ask him;"&mdash;"he shall give you another Comforter, that he may
abide with you forever;"&mdash;"renewing of the Holy Ghost (or of a
holy spirit or the divine power) which he shed on us abundantly;"&mdash;"how
God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and
with power;"&mdash;"upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending
and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the
Holy Ghost: John 1:33." Therefore one plain meaning of the
holy spirit is a miraculous and wonderful power, communicated by
God from heaven to Jesus Christ when he appeared on the earth in
the form of a man, designating him to be the promised Messiah.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>Concerning the Holy Spirit the creed of the ancient Council of
Nice, A.&nbsp;D. 325, says nothing except "we believe in the Holy
Spirit." Of Christ it declares, that he was "the Son of God, the only
begotten of the Father, God of God,&mdash;begotten, not made, &amp;c."
Soon after that council a learned father, <i>Eunomius</i>, who was made
bishop of Cyzicum A. D. 360, advanced the doctrine, that after
God had created his Son before the universe was formed, giving
him divine dignity and creative power, he next created the Holy
Spirit, the first and greatest of all spirits, by his own power indeed
but by the immediate agency also of his Son, giving him power to
sanctify and teach. Afterwards he created all things in heaven and
earth. More modern creeds, which adopt much the same faith with
Eunomius, use the word "proceed" instead of "create," as the
New England Confession of Faith of 1680, which says, "the Holy
Ghost eternally proceeding from the Father and the Son." But
Milton, in his learned Treatise on the Christian doctrine, has
shewn that "proceedeth" in John 15:26, relates to the mission,&mdash;the
sending from God to the earth, not to the nature, of the Spirit:
yet his own faith was, that "the Holy Spirit, inasmuch as he is a
minister of God, and therefore a creature, was created or produced
of the substance of God, not by a natural necessity, but by the
free will of the agent, probably before the foundations of the world
were laid, but later than the Son, and far inferior to him." Dr.
Samuel Clarke of England has taught the same doctrine.&mdash;But the
reader is requested to form his opinion on the chief subject of this
note, not from any human creed or learned man's teaching, but from
his own study of the Bible with his own endowment of reason.
The practical application of the doctrine of the Holy Spirit has
claims to our earnest attention.</p>

<p>In the judgment of Dr. Cotton Mather it is through the Spirit of
God, that Christians find such affections as the following working
in their minds:&mdash;a flaming love towards God and men; a lively
faith in God and in the Savior, the Mediator; a longing desire and
hope of spiritual blessings; a mighty hatred of sin; a bitter sorrow
for sin and its miseries; a noble courage; a total despair of
help in creatures; a fear of the judgments of wickedness; a triumphant
joy in God and in his Christ; a rapturous admiration of the
Maker and Ruler of the world and of his glories. "All true piety,"
he says, "is begun by the enkindling of these affections in the
soul:" and the Spirit, enkindling them, should be sought from God
in the constancy of prayer.</p>

<p><a name="Sonnet_Note_72" id="Sonnet_Note_72"></a><a href="#Sonnet_72"><i>Sonnet 72.</i></a> Since this sonnet has passed through the press, I have
been glad to read a description of Donati's comet and to see a
telescopic view of it in the Family Christian Almanac for 1860.
The comet is named after Donati, the discoverer, who first saw it at
Florence, June 2, 1858. It was seen several months in great splendor
in our country until about Oct. 20th, when it disappeared.
When first observed, it was 200 millions of miles distant from the
sun. Its curved train extended 60 degrees or 51 millions of miles.
When nearest the earth it was 52 millions of miles distant, moving
at the rate of 123 thousand miles an hour. Its greatest distance
from the sun is supposed to be 143 thousand millions of miles; and
astronomers have calculated its period of revolution at nearly 2,000
years, so that its last previous visit to the earth was before the
Christian era. Yet from the extreme point of its journey to the
nearest fixed star who can measure the distance? Who will not
say, "Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty?"</p>

<p>It is worthy of remark, that in respect to the inhabitants of the
various worlds, with which our skies are filled, the revealed word of
God, communicated to man upon the earth, gives us no information.
If beyond a doubt the sun, the moon, the stars, and the comets are
inhabited by intelligent beings; yet of what rank and in what
condition we know nothing. But as we are taught, that there is a
world of "fire," prepared "for the devil and his angels," it may be
that comets are the destined abodes of the wicked and lost.</p>

<p><a name="Sonnet_Note_78" id="Sonnet_Note_78"></a><a href="#Sonnet_78"><i>Sonnet 78.</i></a> To an old man the recollection of a youthful brother
preacher in the far-back period of fifty or more years, who still
preaches the gospel, is replete with interest. It is attended with
the memory of men, who at that period were the fathers in the
ministry,&mdash;as Rogers, Livingston, Mason, and Miller of New York;
Dwight of New Haven; and S. Spring, Morse, Eckley, and Griffin
of Massachusetts.</p>

<p><a name="Sonnet_Note_80" id="Sonnet_Note_80"></a><a href="#Sonnet_80"><i>Sonnet 80.</i></a> The leading truth of the gospel, dear to my heart
since I first began to preach it 56 years ago, is that Jesus Christ
was the Son of God, by whom God made the worlds, and who came
down from heaven and in human flesh was himself the sufferer on
the cross for the sins of men. I use language as men of reason
should use it. I dare not, on the peril of my soul, explain it away
by saying, that the Son of God from heaven united himself to
another spirit or intelligent being, which latter spirit or mind bore
the suffering, ascribed to the Son from heaven. That Christ had
two spirits is the teaching of human theory but not of divine
scripture.</p>

<p>Every man is conscious, that he is one,&mdash;one existence, one
intelligent being, one human being, or an intellect or mind now
dwelling in a human body; and he acknowledges every other man
to be a similar being. He also regards every angel, that comes to
his knowledge by revelation, as one being. God, the Creator of the
universe, we view necessarily as one being. The idea of a duplicate
intellectual being is beyond our thought; it is inconceivable,
an absurdity, a contradiction. Jesus Christ then was either man
or the one Son of God in the form of a man.</p>

<p>That there is "one God and one Mediator between God and men,
the man Christ Jesus" is Paul's teaching. The reason of calling
Christ <em>man</em> is, that "God sent his son in the <em>likeness</em> of sinful
flesh," Rom. 8:3. The Son's intelligent spirit was enough to be
the tenant of one human body without a co-tenancy with a human
spirit, and enough to suffer for the sins of the world.</p>

<p>When Paul speaks of Christ as being once "in the form of God,"
he did not mean, that he was God himself, in whose form or likeness
he was, Phil. 2:6. Then in the next verses, by his being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
"in the form of a servant," "in the likeness of men," "in fashion
as a man," he could not mean, that Christ was a real, perfect man.
But did he first live in heaven, and thence come to the earth to
tabernacle in human flesh and to offer himself as an atoning sacrifice
for the sins of the race of men?</p>

<p>In the first chapter of John's gospel we are taught, that Christ
or the Son of God, called the Word, existed in the beginning with
God and that all things were made by him. At the very commencement
of all created existences in the universe, he existed with God,
and by him all created things in the universe were created. Here
then was a high and glorious dignity in heaven, the Son of God,
before he dwelt in human flesh.</p>

<p>In the third chapter of John we read, that Christ said to Nicodemus,&mdash;"If
I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not;
how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things? And no
man hath ascended up to heaven, but he, that came down from
heaven, even the Son of Man, which is in heaven." The express
contrast of the words&mdash;"ascended up to heaven, came down from
heaven," seems to fix the meaning beyond any possible doubt.&mdash;In
the 6th chapter of John Christ said, as we read, "I came down
from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him, that sent
me."&mdash;"Moses gave you not that bread from heaven, but my Father
giveth you the true bread from heaven. For the bread of God is
he, which cometh from heaven, and giveth life unto the world."
When the Jews murmured at his discourse, because he said, "I am
the bread, which came down from heaven," Jesus repeated his plain
teaching&mdash;"I am the living bread, which came down from heaven:
if any man eat of this bread, he shall live forever: and the bread,
that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the
world." That is, he who came down from God in heaven would
give his flesh, his human body to the agonies of crucifixion for the
salvation of men. Many of his disciples said, "this is an hard
saying: who can hear it?" What was the reply of Christ? It was
this: "does this offend you? What and if ye shall see the Son of
Man ascend up where he was before?" In the 16th chapter of
John we read Christ's words&mdash;"The Father himself loveth you,
because ye have loved me, and have believed, that I came out from
God. I came forth from the Father and am come into the world:
again, I leave the world, and go to the Father." Here again the
contrast of expressions shows the meaning of the phrase, "I am
come into the world." I will adduce only one other passage:&mdash;In
Ephesians 4th we read&mdash;"Now that he ascended, what is it but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?"
"He that descended is the same also, that ascended up far above
all heavens, that he might fill all things." I think it thus most
clearly and amply established in scripture, that the Lamb of God
came down to the earth from the presence of God and laying aside
his high dignity dwelt in a human body, as a man dwells in a body,
and died in agony on the cross. There may be various high
inquiries, which may here spring up. But surely no theory can be
true, which contradicts and overthrows the divine teaching. No
scheme of theology can be true, which denies, that he, who came
down from heaven, could die and did die as a lamb of sacrifice to
God for the sins of the world,&mdash;for this is a denial of the great
doctrine of the atonement, and thus withers up all the hopes of
sinful men. Who can prove, that God could not have a Son derived
from Him before time began, by whom he created the universe, and
who in his most amazing love to us abased himself to man's condition
and died in our stead on this little globe of his own creation?
If we find in the Bible any plain, intelligible teaching of God, will
it do to set up our reason against the teaching of Him, who is infinite
reason and infinite wisdom?</p>

<p>If any truth is plain in the Bible, is it not that Jesus Christ, the
Son of God, in human flesh or in fashion as a man by his sufferings
on the cross <em>made</em> atonement for the sins of the world? Paul
says, Rom. 5:11;&mdash;"We joy in God through our Lord Jesus
Christ, by whom we have received the atonement; and that God
hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son, in whom we
have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:
who is the image of the invisible God:" Coloss. 1:13.&mdash;Peter says,
that his brethren were "redeemed with the precious blood of Christ
as of a lamb without blemish and without spot." Other expressions
are these, Christ "after he had offered one sacrifice for sins
forever, [that is, for perpetuity,] sat down on the right hand of
God:" Heb. 10:12, "Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation
through faith in his blood:" Rom. 3:25, "Unto him, that loved us
and washed us from our sins in his own blood:" Rev. 1:5.&mdash;That
the Son of God, who came down from heaven, was himself a
sufferer and sacrifice on the cross for our sins is every where
taught in scripture. Without believing this how can we regard
Christ as a Redeemer and Savior?</p>

<p><a name="Sonnet_Note_81" id="Sonnet_Note_81"></a><a href="#Sonnet_81"><i>Sonnet 81.</i></a> In order that revealed truths may beam upon the
mind of man and produce their proper effect it is necessary, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
God's revelation be understood and not misapprehended. If two
men attach a different and contradictory meaning to the same
passage of scripture, one of them is in error and fault; and if the
error relates to the character of God and to some very important
doctrine, it may be perilous.</p>

<p>For instance, two of our theologians have taught a contradictory
doctrine, drawn as they thought from scripture, as follows; Jonathan
Edwards maintained, that sin was "not the fruit of any
positive agency or influence of the Most High;"&mdash;"it would be a
reproach and blasphemy to suppose God to be the author of sin" in
the sense of the agent, actor, or doer of a wicked thing. But Dr.
Emmons maintained, that God "produced all the free, voluntary,
moral exercises" of man; that God "creates evil when and where
the good of the universe requires;" that "Satan placed certain
motives before man's mind, which by a certain divine energy took
hold of his heart and led him into sin." This teaching seems
blasphemous, and contradictory to all notions of free, voluntary
agency, as well as to the tenor of scripture. He relies for scripture
proof on Exodus 4:21, where God says in respect to Pharaoh, "I
will harden his heart." But this, rightly understood, is only a
prediction of a certain event, that Pharaoh would harden his own
heart as it is declared he did in ch. 9:34. So in respect to other
quoted passages, it might be shown, that they were misunderstood
and perverted from their proper meaning. We all know by common
sense, by reason, and conscience, that we are free agents; therefore
justly accountable to a holy, sin-hating God. But if God made,
created, produced all our wicked volitions and acts; how can we
regard him as just in punishing us for the very acts, which he
produced? And what can such passages as James 1:13, mean,
"God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man?"</p>

<p><a name="Sonnet_Note_82" id="Sonnet_Note_82"></a><a href="#Sonnet_82"><i>Sonnet 82.</i></a> The following seem to be clear and prominent points
of instruction in the divine Word.</p>

<p>1. There is <span class="smcap">one God</span>, eternal, infinite, all-wise, perfect in goodness,
the creator of the universe. Hence all the gods and idols of
the heathen are vanity and a lie.&mdash;"There is one God the Father of
all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all." Ephes.
2:5.&mdash;"The Lord our God is one Lord."&mdash;"God is one."&mdash;"One
God and one Mediator." Mark 12:29. Galatians 3:20. I Tim.
2:5. Thus throughout the whole scripture the unity of God is
asserted or implied. The name of God occurs 500 or 600 times in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the Bible. "God is one;" one conscious, intelligent being and
voluntary agent. No man in the exercise of his reason has any
doubts as to his own oneness, or as to the oneness of any brother
man or of any angel, of whom he may think or speak. If I am
conscious, that I am a single intellectual being, and necessarily
regard every other man as such; then it cannot enter my thoughts,
that the one God is a compound being.</p>

<p>2. God has a <span class="smcap">Son</span> in heaven, by whom he made the worlds, and
whom he sent from heaven to earth, to tabernacle for a while in
human flesh, voluntarily abased in his powers to the condition of
a man, to be a Mediator and Savior. In John, chapter 1, Jesus
Christ is called "the Son of God," "the only-begotten of the
Father," "the Lamb of God," who was "in the beginning with
God," and "by whom all things were made."</p>

<p>3. That the Son of God is a being distinct from God is most
obvious from the whole New Testament. In Phil. I, Paul prays
for grace and peace "from God our Father and from the Lord
Jesus Christ." He adds, "I thank my God upon every remembrance
of you." So throughout his epistle God and Jesus Christ
are most plainly distinct beings. He says, that Christ condescended
to come in fashion "as a man," on which account God highly
exalted him: here are two beings: and Christ will be extolled at last
to "the glory of God the Father."&mdash;He "worshipped God in the
spirit and rejoiced in Christ Jesus."&mdash;Here are again two beings.
Near the close of the epistle he says&mdash;"my God shall supply all
your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus." How
strange to Paul must have been the doctrine, that Christ was one
of several beings making up one God?</p>

<p>But the same distinction is clearly and fully set forth by Paul in
all his other epistles as well as in that to the Philippians. He
begins most of them with a prayer like that in the epistle to the
Romans,&mdash;"Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the
Lord Jesus Christ." Then he "thanks God through Jesus Christ
for them all;" the God, whom he serves "in the gospel of his Son."
Read also,&mdash;"the righteousness of God by faith of Jesus Christ;"&mdash;"we
have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ;"&mdash;"we
were reconciled to God by the death of his Son;"&mdash;"the gift of
God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord;"&mdash;nothing can
"separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our
Lord;"&mdash;Paul prays, that his brethren may "glorify God even the
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ;"&mdash;and after more of similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
language he ends this epistle,&mdash;"To God only wise be glory
through Jesus Christ forever. Amen."</p>

<p>If it be asked, in what sense is Christ God's "<em>Son</em>, whom he hath
appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds?"
I answer, the word doubtless means, that he was derived from God,
that he sprung from God, that he received his being from God
before the creation of the universe. He is called God's "first-begotten"
and "only-begotten." It is unnecessary and may be
useless for us to enter into any inquiries and discussions concerning
hypostasis, person, nature, being, essence, substance, and other
logical and metaphysical terms employed by theologians, which do
not afford a particle of light; but we must believe, that Christ was
derived from God and possesses the very attributes and endured
the sufferings, ascribed to him in the scriptures. If we ascribe to
him a nature not ascribed to him in the Bible, one incapable of
suffering, and then deny the sufferings, which are ascribed to him;
what do we but contradict the word of God and reject the doctrine
of the Atonement by the sufferings of Christ, which is the foundation
of the sinner's hope? If a learned doctor should assert, that
if Christ was the agent of God in the creation of the universe, and
is his agent in its government, then he could not be derived from
God; the learned man puts forth only the words of folly. As
derived from God, why might not the Son be as much superior to
the highest angel, as man is superior in knowledge and powers to
the beetle under our foot? Why could he not derive from God and
exercise under God the powers of creation?</p>

<p>"He is the image of the invisible God, the first-born of every
creature; for by him were all things created, that are in heaven,
and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones,
or dominions, or principalities or powers: all things were created
by him and for him:"&mdash;"it pleased the father, that in him should all
fullness dwell." Col. 1:15, 16. So in Heb. 1:3, Christ is called
"the express image of God's person;" where the Greek word,
translated person, means nature, essence, or being, and the assertion
is, that Christ is "a clear and strong image of the essence or
nature of the divine majesty." It may be, that for this reason the
title of god is given to him; and with very obvious propriety may
we ascribe to him divinity or call him a divine being, without
contending for the impossibility that he is the very being, whose
image he is, or that his own is the very nature, person, hypostasis,
or substance, of which he stands the express character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>According to our English Bible the Son of God under the name of
the Word seems to be called God by the apostle John, ch. 1, v. 1.
But it was not the purpose of John to represent the Word as the
infinite, supreme, almighty God. <span class="smcap">Origen</span>, who wrote in Greek,
in the third century, and understood the language better than any
modern critic, says, that John's assertion is that, "the <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">logos</i>, or
word, was <em>a god</em>," using the word god in its inferior, well-known
sense, as is proved by his omission of the article. If he had
inserted the article, he would have said, that "the logos was <em>the</em>
God, the supreme God, Jehovah." The plain teaching is, there is
one God. With him was the <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">logos</i> in the beginning, an exalted,
glorious being; a second, inferior God; a being derived from God;
and in this sense a divine being.&mdash;Besides Origen, Philo and
several other fathers of the three first centuries speak of John's
omission of the article here as a proof that by the word god he did
not mean the Supreme God. Consider also, that if the logos
existed "<em>with</em> God," then he was not the very God, with whom he
existed.&mdash;On the other hand, it is a matter of no weight that when
the supreme God is meant, yet the article is often omitted; for it is
an established principle that it may be omitted when the name of
God is sufficiently definite without it. In John 1:6,&mdash;"a man
sent from God:" here is an omission of it as unnecessary. So v.
12, 13, 18. Origen again says,&mdash;"Angels are called gods because
they are divine; but we are not commanded to worship them in the
place of God, and hence they are not really gods." He says, the
article is withheld, when what is called god is a being different
"from the self-existent God, having a communicated divinity,
being a divine person." Such also was the opinion of Clemens
Alexandrinus and Eusebius; and they were men more competent
to decide a matter concerning the construction of the Greek language
than any modern critic.&mdash;In several of the first centuries it
was the judgment of such Fathers as Justin, Athenagoras, Tatian,
Theophilus, Clemens, Origen, &amp;c., that the word god as applied to
Christ denoted a celestial nature, superior to all creatures, but
inferior to the Supreme God. But the authority of Christ himself
is more decisive,&mdash;"My Father is greater than I:" and the whole
of scripture shows, that the one perfect God and his Son are two
distinct intelligent Beings. As the word in Greek, Acts 28:6, has
no article our translators have very properly said "a god." If any
one will look at 2 Thess. 2:4, he will see, that the word God occurs
four times and undistinguished in the English Testament, but in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
the Greek the word for God appears once&mdash;"in the temple of God"&mdash;<em>with</em>
the article, showing that the true Supreme God is meant,&mdash;and
three times <em>without</em> the article, showing, that the word is used
in an inferior sense, that a false god was intended. Dr. Macknight's
translation is as follows,&mdash;"above every one, who is
called <em>a god</em> or an object of worship. So that he, in the temple of
<span class="smcap">God</span>, as <em>a god</em> sitteth, openly shewing himself, that he is <em>a god</em>."
It is thus, that the Word in John 1st is called a god, and not God
the Supreme, the Almighty Jehovah.</p>

<p>When <i>Tatian</i>, about A. D. 165 speaks of "a god, who was born
in the form of man" and of "the suffering God," he certainly did
not mean, that Christ was the Supreme God, incapable of suffering.
It was the doctrine of Apollinaris, two hundred years later, that Christ
assumed a human body with a sentient soul like that of the inferior
animals, but not assuming an intelligent or rational human spirit.
He could see no reason why Christ should have two intelligent
natures and two free wills. In his judgment the Son of God, who
came down from heaven, was the only rational tenant of his human
body, and the only rational sufferer on the cross, making a real
atonement for sin. For scriptural proof he rested on John 1:14,
"the Word was made flesh." His doctrine was doubtless this,&mdash;that
the Son of God in his high spiritual nature, in which he came
down from heaven in order to suffer, was the real sufferer on the
cross: not that he was God incapable of suffering, and incapable
of making any atonement.</p>

<p>On the distinction between Almighty God and his Son, derived
from him before the creation, the Creed of the Church of England
is very explicit:&mdash;"I believe in one God, the Father Almighty,
Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible:
and in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, begotten
of his Father before all worlds, &amp;c."&mdash;"Who for us men and
for our salvation came down from heaven, &amp;c."</p>

<p>The doctrine of the New England Synod at Boston in 1680 was
the same: "The Father is of none, neither begotten nor proceeding;
the Son is eternally begotten of the Father." If many of our
American theologians at the present day reject the doctrine of the
derivation of the Son from God, they are not responsible to the
Synod's Confession or Creed, but certainly they are to holy Scripture
and to Reason.</p>

<p><a name="Sonnet_Note_86" id="Sonnet_Note_86"></a><a href="#Sonnet_86"><i>Sonnet 86.</i></a> Occom was a distinguished Indian preacher, the first
who visited England. Born at Mohegan near Norwich, Conn., he
was educated 4 years in Wheelock's Indian School at Lebanon, and
was himself a school teacher of the Montauk Indians 10 or 12 years.
In 1759, at the age of 36, he was ordained by a presbytery. He
preached in Great Britain in 1766, 1767, and 1768, between 300
and 400 sermons, employed by Mr. Wheelock. For the remaining
24 years of his life he continued to preach; and he died at New
Stockbridge, near Utica, in July 1792, aged 69. The author has
prepared for the press a Memoir of Occom, drawn from the papers
of Dr. Wheelock which are in his hands and from Occom's own
manuscript journals.</p>

standing between a plough and an altar, with the inscription, <i>Ready
for Either</i>, the device was thought very appropriate to express the
disposition of the true Christian missionary, ready for toil and ready
also to be a sacrifice, if called to die in his master's service, "not
holding his life dear unto himself."</p>

<p><a name="Sonnet_Note_96" id="Sonnet_Note_96"></a><a href="#Sonnet_96"><i>Sonnet 96.</i></a> Sickness prevented me from visiting my nephew and
meeting with his guests on an interesting occasion. The old house,
the home of my childhood and my dwelling for seven years of my
ministry,&mdash;the house built by my father, the first minister of
Pittsfield, in the wilderness,&mdash;was superseded by an elegant mansion,
built by his grandson bearing his own name, Thomas Allen.
The event was commemorated by a select and happy company
of aged men.</p>

<p><a name="Sonnet_Note_98" id="Sonnet_Note_98"></a><a href="#Sonnet_98"><i>Sonnet 98.</i></a> I first visited Niagara Falls 56 years ago. Having
just been licensed by the ministers of Berkshire county to preach
the gospel, I mounted my horse in Aug. 1804 and rode out more
than 400 miles through the western wilderness of New York as far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
as Lake Erie and Niagara river, preaching in various places to little
assemblies in log cabins. Buffalo, now a great city, was then a
village of 19 houses. Three miles below there was the ferry at
Black Rock; and there I saw the famous Indian chief, Red Jacket,
attending his little grand-daughter as from a rock she threw her
hook into the great stream. Thence I rode down on the Canada
side 15 miles to the wondrous Falls.</p>

<p>Besides the lesson of solemn warning and terror another of a
character acceptable and gladdening was offered to my thoughts,
as I stood on the river's bank at the Falls; for I beheld a rainbow
of a full semi-circle or more, the ends almost under my feet,
stretching over the awful chasm, deepest in color low down at
each extremity, where the turmoil of mist was the thickest. This
lesson I here put in rhyme, and with it, in accordance with the
sentiment of the hundredth sonnet which a few days ago passed
through the press, I now close this little book.</p>

<p>If the reader will consider, that my threatening illness has now
had a continuance of many months and that to-day closes seventy-six
years of my life, he will find reason to conclude, that my
thoughts here expressed, although in verse, are utterances in the
sincerity of faith and the honesty of truth: and so I bid him farewell,
wishing him "a happy New Year" and a blessed Eternity!</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
